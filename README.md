Qt Puppies is a small project done for the Object Oriented Programming course. Basically is an application that allows breeding and daycare managers to have a better overview of the dogs, since, with a greater number of dogs, it is difficult to always have an up-to-date and orderly picture of the situation. Various functions are available, such as search by name, size, breed, etc...
